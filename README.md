## Installing

### Extraction
Extract userChrome.css userContent.css from the .rar file into your \chrome folder.
Don't know where \chrome is? It's simple:
* Open Firefox

* In the urlbar, type in:
	* about:support

* Under "Application Basics", look for the "Profile Folder". Click "Open Folder".

* That's where the \chrome folder should be. It should look something like:
	* C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\[profileid]\chrome

* If you can't find the chrome folder, feel free to make one and extract the files there. 

### Enabling
Once you have that installed, you need to enable css alterations in Firefox:
* Open Firefox.

* In the urlbar, type in about:config

* "Accept the risk".

* Search for toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets

* Enable it, obviously.

* Close firefox and reopen it.

Once you've done that, Firefox Review should be up and running.
